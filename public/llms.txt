## What is GetA2PApproved?

GetA2PApproved is an AI-powered platform that helps businesses generate the compliance documents required for A2P 10DLC SMS campaign registration. A2P 10DLC (Application-to-Person 10-Digit Long Code) is the industry standard for business text messaging in the United States, regulated by The Campaign Registry (TCR) and enforced by carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon.

Businesses that send SMS messages (appointment reminders, order updates, marketing texts, etc.) must register their campaigns through TCR, which requires specific compliance documents:

1. **Privacy Policy** — Must disclose SMS data collection, consent practices, opt-out procedures, and carrier obligations.
2. **Terms & Conditions** — Must outline messaging terms, frequency disclosures, STOP/HELP keywords, and carrier liability disclaimers.
3. **Submission Language** — The exact text submitted to TCR describing the campaign's purpose, message content, and consent flow.

These documents must be consistent with each other and meet specific carrier requirements. GetA2PApproved generates all three documents from a single questionnaire, ensuring cross-document consistency and compliance.
